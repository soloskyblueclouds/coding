**QUERY COMPOSITION**

How Compositions can reduce privacy and how to prevent it ?


What does Composition in Differential Privacy really Mean?

Composition is collection of k queries made, ensuring privacy is maintained even under multiple analyses.

Composition of 'k' interactive queries that provide at least (kε, kδ) differential privacy  guarantee, up to some smooth gradual degradation of privacy. Note that each query made on any one of the pair of databases(One database with real data & another with one real data modified) everytime meets individual  (ε, δ)-differential privacy as well. 

Below provides an illustration of composition of k queries.
