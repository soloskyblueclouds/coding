My Journey towards becoming Full stack ML/DL developer & a data scientist.  
1. Fast ai course [Practical Deep Learning for Coders] (https://course.fast.ai)
```
Status : Working on intro1.py. Followed the code of downloading the images & running cnn_learner to classifying if the uploaded image is a cat or a dog and tried using different images of rats/snakes/elephants and one cat image (maybe out of 6)to see if it really gives the accuracy. accuracy was still showing 0.99 which was not clear why!! My First ever attempt to understand the API itself through a small piece of code was super fun!>
